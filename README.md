# Introduction to Full Stack Development

## Overview
We will be covering the basic concepts of web development, from the linking a database in the backend to creating simple components in the frontend, over the course of three workshops. This is not a comprehensive look at all aspects of full stack development, but rather a boost for students to begin their own explorations with (hopefully) less questions than before. At the end of the three workshops, you will have a solid basis on which you can build other simple applications. Each workshop is created to be largely standalone and can be viewed independently.
